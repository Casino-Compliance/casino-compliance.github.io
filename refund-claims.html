    <h1>Refund Claims & Player Complaints</h1>

    <p style="max-width:760px;">
      Casino Compliance coordinates and structures complaints and claims arising from
      disputes between players and online gambling operators. This includes, but is
      not limited to, refund-related matters.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:48px;">Scope of Complaints</h2>
    <p style="max-width:760px;">
      Player complaints may concern a wide range of issues, including account handling,
      transaction processing, responsible gambling obligations, and the application
      of operator terms and procedures.
    </p>

    <ul style="max-width:760px; line-height:1.8;">
      <li>Disputed deposits, withdrawals, or account balances</li>
      <li>Account restrictions, closures, or verification issues</li>
      <li>Alleged breaches of responsible gambling measures</li>
      <li>Self-exclusion handling and enforcement failures</li>
      <li>General complaints regarding operator conduct or procedure</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin-top:56px;">Compliance-Based Assessment</h2>
    <p style="max-width:760px;">
      Complaints are assessed against applicable regulatory frameworks, operator
      obligations, and generally accepted player protection standards. Particular
      attention is given to whether operators have fulfilled their duty of care
      once notified of relevant circumstances.
    </p>

    <p style="max-width:760px;">
      Where transactions or account actions occur following documented notification
      (for example, a self-exclusion request or responsible gambling notice), such
      actions may be subject to challenge on compliance grounds.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:56px;">Refund Considerations</h2>
    <p style="max-width:760px;">
      Refund-related claims do not solely concern individual deposits. They may arise
      from a broader pattern of non-compliant conduct, including the continued acceptance
      of funds despite the existence of mandatory player protection obligations.
    </p>

    <p style="max-width:760px;">
      Each case is reviewed individually based on its factual circumstances, available
      documentation, and the regulatory context in which the operator is licensed.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:56px;">Process Orientation</h2>
    <p style="max-width:760px;">
      Casino Compliance does not pursue speculative claims. All complaints are structured,
      documented, and communicated in a formal manner, with clearly defined timelines
      and escalation pathways.
    </p>
